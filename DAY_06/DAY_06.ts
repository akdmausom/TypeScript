// To specify the type of an array like [1, 2, 3], you can use the syntax number[]
// You may also see this written as Array<number>, which means the same thing. Weâ€™ll learn more about the syntax T<U> when we cover generics.

const arr:Number[] = [1,2,3,4,5]

arr.push(123,321,221,22,)

const arr2:Array<Number>=[1,2,3,4,5]

arr2.push(123,321,221,22,)
